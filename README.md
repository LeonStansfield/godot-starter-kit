# Godot-Starter-Kit
A project full of prefabs and scripts that I can easily drag and drop into new 3D godot projects.

This project currently contains:

-A basic enemy AI system that will 'see' the player and pathfind towards their last seen position with a basic state machine

-A basic first person 3D charachter controller

-A 3rd person 3D charachter controller designed for platforming

-A basic pause menu and pause system

-A basic 3D racing controller

-A bullet prototype and scripts for 3D shooters

-A 3D camera shake script and prefab scene.

I have tried to comment my code, and know not all of it is optimized or amazing, but it functions so hopefully it will help!
